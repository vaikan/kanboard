Sharing boards and tasks
========================

By default, boards are private but it's possible to make a board public.

A public board **cannot be modified, it's a read-only access**.
This access is protected by a random token, only people who have the right URL can see the board.

Public boards are automatically refreshed every 60 seconds.
Task details are also available in read-only.

Usage examples:

- Share your board with someone outside of your organization
- Display the board on a large screen in your office

Enable public access
--------------------

Select your project, then click on "Public access" and finally click on the button "Enable public access".

When the public access is enabled, a couple of links are generated:

- Public board view
- RSS feed subscription link
- iCalendar subscription link

![Disable public access](screenshots/project-disable-sharing.png)

You can also disable the public access whenever you want.

Each time, you enable or disable the public access a new random token is generated.
**The previous links will not work anymore**.
