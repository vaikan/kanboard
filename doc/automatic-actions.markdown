Automatic Actions
=================

To minimize the user interaction, Kanboard support automated actions.

Each automatic action is defined like that:

- An event to listen
- Action linked to this event
- Eventually there is some parameters to define

Each project has a different set of automatic actions, the configuration panel is located on the project listing page, just click on the link **Automatic actions**.

Here are some examples used in real life:

### When I move a task to the column "Done", automatically close this task

- Choose action: **Close a task in a specific column**
- Choose the event: **Move a task to another column**
- Define action parameter: **Column = Done** (this is the destination column)

### When I move a task to the column "To be validated", assign this task to a specific user

- Choose the action: **Assign the task to a specific user**
- Choose the event: **Move a task to another column**
- Define the action parameters: **Column = To be validated** and **User = Bob** (Bob is our tester)

### When I move a task to the column "Work in progress", assign this task to the current user

- Choose action: **Assign the task to the person who does the action when the column is changed**
- Choose the event: **Move a task to another column**

### When a task is completed, duplicate this task to another project

Let's say we have two projects "Customer orders" and "Production", once the order is validated, swap it to the "Production" project.

- Choose action: **Duplicate the task to another project**
- Choose the event: **Closing a task**
- Define action parameters: **Column = Validated** and **Project = Production**

### When a task is moved to the last column, move the exact same task to another project

Let's say we have two projects "Ideas" and "Development", once the idea is validated, swap it to the "Development" project.

- Choose action: **Move the task to another project**
- Choose the event: **Move a task to another column**
- Define action parameters: **Column = Validated** and **Project = Development**

### I want to assign automatically a color to the user Bob
